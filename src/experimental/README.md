# experimental plugins
This directory contains experimental plugins that sort of work for me, but probably not for everyone.

The plugins in this folder are play-tested on a server, but without proper unittests. I see some potential for further customization if they turn out to be worthy for use on more than one server, but this will probably take some more time.

## Disclaimer
Use these plugins at your own risk. There may be unintended consequences if used with other plugins, that I did not test for.

You probably need some basic python knowledge to make use of any of these plugins in this folder. You have been warned.
